    <h1>Styling with html and css</h1>
    <p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.

        CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media.
        
        CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once.
        
        CSS can be added to HTML elements in 3 ways:
        
        Inline - by using the style attribute in HTML elements
        Internal - by using a style element in the head section
        External - by using an external CSS file
        The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in separate CSS files. However, here we will use inline and internal styling, because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier for you to try it yourself.</p>
<h2>Inline css</h2>
<p>An inline CSS is used to apply a unique style to a single HTML element.

    An inline CSS uses the style attribute of an HTML element.
    
    This example sets the text color of the h1 element to blue:</p>

    <h3>Internal css</h3>

    <p>An internal CSS is used to define a style for a single HTML page.

        An internal CSS is defined in the head section of an HTML page, within a style element:</p>


        <h4>External Css</h4>
        <p>An external style sheet is used to define the style for many HTML pages.

            With an external style sheet, you can change the look of an entire web site, by changing one file!
            
            To use an external style sheet, add a link to it in the ead section of the HTML page:</p>

            <h5>CSS fonts</h5>

            <p>The CSS color property defines the text color to be used.

                The CSS font-family property defines the font to be used.
                
                The CSS font-size property defines the text size to be used.</p>
 <h6>CSS border</h6>
 <p>The CSS border property defines a border around an HTML element</p>

 <h5>CSS padding</h5>
 <p>The CSS padding property defines a padding (space) between the text and the border:</p>
